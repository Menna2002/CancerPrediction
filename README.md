# Cancer Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Models

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis is a cancer classification dataset. The goal is to classify tumors as either:

- **Benign cancer (B)**: Indicates a non-cancerous tumor that is at a normal stage.
- **Malignant cancer (M)**: Indicates a very dangerous, cancerous tumor.

The dataset contains various features extracted from cell nuclei images to aid in this classification.

## Data Analysis
Provide an overview of the data analysis steps taken, such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering, if applicable

## Machine Learning Models

-Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes


## Model Comparison
Compare the performance of all four models based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Any other relevant metrics

## Parameter Tuning
Briefly discuss the parameter tuning process for each model and its impact on performance.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings from the analysis and model application. Discuss which model performed best and any insights gained from the process.
